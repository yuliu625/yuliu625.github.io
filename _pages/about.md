I am a Master's candidate in the School of Computer Science and Technology at Fudan University.

My primary research focus is on Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a specialized interest in Decision Intelligence. Currently, my research is dedicated to exploring and developing AI Agents and Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to build systems capable of complex reasoning and autonomous decision-making.
